<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Ala Baccari</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Full-Stack Developer & AI Engineer</h3>

I'm a passionate Full-Stack Developer and AI Engineer with over 2 years of professional experience who thrives at the intersection of traditional software development and cutting-edge AI innovation.

Currently, I'm building and running <a href="https://www.lazybrains.pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LazyBrains</a>, an AI-powered study platform that generates personalized flashcards and quizzes for students using advanced AI technology.

My expertise spans both full-stack SaaS solutions and AI-powered platforms, allowing me to tackle real-world problems through multiple technological approaches. Whether building robust web applications or intelligent agent frameworks with RAG systems, I'm driven by entrepreneurial spirit to create meaningful solutions that automate workflows and solve complex business challenges.

My technical foundation covers modern full-stack development, AI/ML technologies, and cloud architectures, enabling me to bridge traditional software engineering with emerging AI capabilities.

When I'm not developing AI agents or full-stack applications, I'm contributing to open-source projects like <a href="https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3A10Ala10+is%3Amerged" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agno</a>, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with intelligent automation.
