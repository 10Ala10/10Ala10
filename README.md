<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Ala Baccari</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Full-Stack Developer & AI Engineer </h3>


I'm a passionate AI Engineer and Full-Stack Developer with over 2 years of professional experience who thrives at the intersection of traditional software development and cutting-edge AI innovation. My expertise spans both full-stack SaaS solutions and AI-powered platforms, allowing me to tackle real-world problems through multiple technological approaches. Whether building robust web applications or intelligent agent frameworks with RAG systems, I'm driven by entrepreneurial spirit to create meaningful solutions that automate workflows and solve complex business challenges. My technical foundation covers modern full-stack development, AI/ML technologies, and cloud architectures, enabling me to bridge traditional software engineering with emerging AI capabilities. When I'm not developing AI agents or full-stack applications, I'm contributing to open-source projects like [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno), pushing the boundaries of what's possible with intelligent automation.
